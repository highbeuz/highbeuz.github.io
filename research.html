        <h2>Early Career Research (MSc)</h2>
        <p>
            During my early research career at CERAAS (Thiès, Senegal) as an MSc intern, my
            work focused on identifying contrasting millet (Pennisetum glaucum) accessions
            for terminal drought tolerance. This research combined detailed phenotypic
            characterization of drought-related traits with genotypic analyses to
            distinguish tolerant and sensitive accessions under water-limited conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Building on this experience, I contributed to a large-scale study of sorghum
            genetic diversity from marginal production environments in Senegal using SSR
            molecular markers. This work involved extensive field surveys, farmer-led
            landrace collection, laboratory-based genotyping, and population genetic
            analyses.
        </p>
        <p>
            The study provided one of the first insights into the structure and diversity
            of sorghum landraces cultivated in marginal agroecological zones, supporting
            sustainable in situ conservation and genetic resource management.

        <h2>PhD Research – UAV High-Throughput Phenotyping for Drought Tolerance</h2>
        
        <p>
            My PhD research evaluated the potential of UAV-based high-throughput
            phenotyping to accelerate sorghum breeding under water-limited
            conditions. Multi-environment field experiments conducted in Senegal
            under contrasting irrigation regimes integrated UAV-mounted
            multispectral imagery with ground-based measurements.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vegetation indices including NDVI, GNDVI, and MSAVI2 showed strong and
            consistent correlations with field-measured LAI and biomass
            (R² > 0.80) across growth stages, enabling robust regression-based
            prediction of drought-related traits.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:40px;">
            Cross-environment analyses showed that while UAV phenotyping is scalable
            and efficient, site-specific model calibration is required when canopy
            structure, soil background, or management practices differ.

            UAV-derived plant height estimates were obtained using DSM–DTM approaches and

            season, demonstrating the robustness of UAV-based structural trait extraction.

        <p>
            A comparative genome-wide association study (GWAS) using both manually
            measured and UAV-derived biomass identified identical genomic regions
            associated with drought tolerance, validating UAV phenotyping as a
            reliable substitute for traditional methods.

        <strong>
            Overall, this work demonstrates that UAV-based phenotyping is a powerful,
            non-destructive tool for integrating phenomics and genomics to accelerate
            the selection of drought-resilient sorghum genotypes.

                    During my postdoctoral research, I worked on a non-destructive
                    framework to predict soil nitrate (SNO₃) and soil organic carbon (SOC)
                    using UAV-based multispectral imagery and machine learning. This study explores how UAV multispectral imagery capturing plant vegetation responses can be used to predict soil organic carbon and nitrate, highlighting the close relationship between crop growth patterns and soil nutrient storage.

                    This work demonstrates the potential of UAV-based phenotyping to support cost-effective soil health assessment.

        <h3 style="margin-top:60px;">Grain Quality Modeling Using UAV and Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>
            I led a multi-year (2023–2024) study integrating machine learning, UAV-based phenotyping, physiological measurements, and agronomic management data to model key sorghum grain biochemical traits. Using commercial sorghum hybrids grown under different management practices (precision nitrogen, cover cropping, and no-till), we developed predictive models for crude protein, starch, amylose, lysine, and crude fat with the goal of reducing reliance on costly laboratory analyses. Regularized regression models (LASSO, ELN) achieved high predictive accuracy for protein and amylose, while PLS and Bayesian Ridge performed best for starch and lysine.
        </p>
        <p>
            The study revealed strong genotype × management × year interactions, highlighting the importance of multi-year data for model generalization. Our results demonstrate the potential of combining UAV-derived indices, physiological traits, and machine learning to support cost-effective grain quality assessment and precision breeding strategies in sorghum.

            Hybrid Deep-Supervised Learning for Lodging Detection and Spatial Analysis (Ongoing)
        </h3>

        <div class="gallery-item" style="box-shadow:none; background:none;">
            <p>
                This ongoing project develops a UAV-based high-throughput phenotyping framework to detect, classify, and predict sorghum lodging across environments, addressing the limitations of labor-intensive and subjective field scoring. Multispectral drone imagery, ground phenotypic measurements, and hybrid machine learning models were integrated across multi-location trials in Missouri and South Carolina during the 2023–2024 seasons. Convolutional neural networks were used for feature extraction and coupled with Random Forest and XGBoost models to classify lodging type (root, stem, or non-lodged) with accuracies up to ~91% and to predict lodging severity with moderate but meaningful performance (R² ≈ 0.67). Spatial lodging maps revealed strong genotype-by-environment interactions, highlighting the combined roles of plant architecture and physiological traits in lodging susceptibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of UAV-enabled hybrid modeling as a scalable and objective tool for lodging phenotyping, supporting the selection of lodging-resilient sorghum genotypes and improved crop management strategies.
